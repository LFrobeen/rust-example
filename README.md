## About Rust

</a>

[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and reference counting is optional.

## About Nickel.rs

[Nickel.rs](https://nickel-org.github.io/) is a simple and lightweight foundation for web applications written in Rust. Its API is inspired by the popular express framework for JavaScript.
